# Accounts-Manager
## Account Manager app to track transactions with friends and family

*This is a fork of the original project carried out during my undergrad at RVCE.*

Accounts Manager is an android based application that manages credit amongst two
individuals, that is, the user and any of their contact. Accounts Manager is essentially a
digital ledger that helps keep track of transactions for the user. The UI facilitates the user
to enter the type of transaction (borrowing as well as lending) and automatically calculates
the amount to be gotten or given. This eliminates the need to keep a tab of transactions on
a memo and manually calculate the balance. The Application also keeps a tab of the reason
for a particular transaction and displays it for cross verification. The App also has an SMS
feature and sends a message to the contact of the user so that the contact may have a copy
of the transaction and they may contact the user to make the necessary changes in case any
false data is entered.
The application has been developed using Android Studio which is the official integrated
development environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains
IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. The App has
been programmed using Java.
The data has been stored on Firebase which offers a real-time database functionality. The
service provides application developers an API that allows application data to be
synchronized across clients and stored in Firebase's cloud. The integration of firebase to
the app can be directly done through the android studio environment. The real-time
database follows a JSON tree structure to store the data using nodes. Each node can be
accessed traversing the tree by using appropriate references to the database.
